# GnV
This is the code repository for 50.017 Graphics & Visualisation Spring 2018 Module. The shattering is inspired by the 2D Voronoi Shattering. The physics simulation is based on [Chris Hecker's articles](http://chrishecker.com/Rigid_body_dynamics).

The physics simulation code is found in ```Collider2.cs``` file.

## Matrix Code
As Matrix3x3 is required for this code, the class for Matrix3x3 is found in ```Matrix3x3.cs```. The code is adapted and modified from MIT's vecmath class Matrixf.cpp.

# Instructions
Launch and load the Game Demo folder to explore. Suggested to git clone as the files are big. the KeyNotFoundException error can be ignored.
